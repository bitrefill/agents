# Use, Redeem, and Activate After Purchase

Use this reference when the user has **already bought** something on Bitrefill and wants to use it: redeem a gift card, activate an eSIM, or confirm a top-up.

## Where to Find Past Purchases

- **Dashboard:** bitrefill.com/dashboard — all orders, codes, and (where applicable) activation links or QR codes.
- **Email:** Order confirmation usually contains codes or links. User can search inbox for "Bitrefill".

## Gift Cards — How to Use

1. Get the **code** (and any link) from the order confirmation page or email, or from the dashboard.
2. Go to the **brand’s website or app** (e.g. Amazon, Netflix, Steam).
3. Find **redeem gift card** / **add gift card** (often in account, payment, or gift card section).
4. Enter the code and apply. The balance or credit is then available on that account.

**Remind:** The card is for the region shown at purchase (e.g. Amazon US). Use on the matching site (e.g. amazon.com for US).

## Mobile Top-ups — How to Confirm

- **No code to redeem.** Airtime (or data bundle) is applied directly to the **phone number** entered at checkout.
- User should **check balance** on the phone (e.g. USSD, carrier app, or phone settings) or wait a few minutes and retry if it’s not updated.
- If there’s a delay, suggest checking the dashboard and email for order status; support can help if the order succeeded but balance didn’t update.

## eSIMs — How to Activate

1. Get the **QR code** and instructions from the order confirmation or dashboard.
2. **Before or during travel:** On the phone, open **Settings → Cellular / Mobile Data → Add eSIM** (wording may vary by device).
3. **Scan the QR code** or enter details manually if the device asks. Install the eSIM profile.
4. **Select the Bitrefill eSIM** for data when in the destination country (and disable or lower priority of home SIM if desired to avoid roaming).

**Compatibility:** Most recent iPhones (e.g. iPhone XS and later) and many Android devices support eSIM. User can check in device settings.

## If Something Goes Wrong

- **Code not working:** Confirm the code was entered correctly and that the user is on the correct region/site for that brand. If it still fails, suggest Bitrefill support with order details.
- **Top-up not received:** Confirm the number and carrier were correct; allow a few minutes. Then dashboard and support.
- **eSIM not installing:** Confirm device supports eSIM and the correct QR was used. Try again or use manual entry if provided; then support if needed.

Always point the user to **bitrefill.com/dashboard** for a single place to see all orders and codes.
