# Getting Product and Pricing Info on Bitrefill

Use this reference when the user needs **details** about a product: price, availability, denominations, or country restrictions.

## Where Information Lives

- **Product pages:** Each product has a page with price (often in local currency), available denominations or amounts, and country/region eligibility.
- **Category pages:** Gift card categories and country filters show what’s available in a region.
- **Checkout:** Final price may include fees or conversion; shown before payment.

## What to Clarify for the User

### For gift cards

- **Country/region:** Which country the card is for (e.g. Amazon US vs UK). A US card will not work in another region.
- **Denominations:** Fixed (e.g. $25, $50) or custom; shown on the product page. Larger amounts sometimes offer better value.
- **Currency:** Site can show prices in user’s local currency; crypto is converted at checkout.

### For mobile top-ups

- **Carrier and country:** Must match the phone number. Denominations and options depend on carrier.
- **Amounts:** List of available top-up amounts on the carrier’s product page.

### For eSIMs

- **Destination:** Country or region (e.g. Europe, Asia).
- **Data and validity:** e.g. 5GB / 30 days. Compare plans if the user cares about price per GB or length of trip.
- **Device compatibility:** Most modern smartphones (e.g. iPhone XS+, recent Android) support eSIM; user can check device settings.

## Common Questions

- **“Is X available in my country?”**  
  Direct user to the product or category page and have them select their country; availability is shown there.

- **“How much does Y cost?”**  
  Prices are on the product page. For crypto, mention that the final amount may depend on exchange rate at checkout; Lightning is often fast and low-fee.

- **“What denominations are available?”**  
  Listed on the product page for that brand/carrier/plan.

- **“Can I use this card/plan in Z country?”**  
  Gift cards: check the card’s region (e.g. “Amazon US”). eSIMs: check the plan’s covered countries. Top-ups: country is set by the phone number/carrier.

Always confirm or infer **country** (and **carrier** for top-ups) before giving final availability or pricing guidance.
